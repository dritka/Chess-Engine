Features to be implemented

--> Aesthetics
- Add more piece themes
- Give the user the options to choose the pieces they want to play (white or black)

--> Functionality
- Implement the minimax algorithm
- Optimize minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- Optimize the move calculation function
- Debug and resolve en passant issue [Done]
- Test and make sure en passant works correctly [Done]
- In the case when a check is given, stop the user from making a move
that leaves the king vulnerable to attack again
- Debug and resolve en passant issue
- Test and make sure en passant works correctly
- In the case when a check is given, stop the user from making a move
that leaves the king vulnerable to attack again
- Cache the valid moves of a piece, this way when a piece returns
to a square that it has previously visited we won't have to recalculate
its valid moves
- In the case of the kings, we need to check if there are any opponent pieces
that stop the king from moving to any of its valid squares, in this case we
need to also update the kings pieces if this certain opponent piece is moved.

--> Remarks
Currently the way the app is structures seems a bit messy and not very easily modifiable.
It should be refactored in a way such that it is easier to integrate new feature into the
application, such as new game modes, new moves and so on.
