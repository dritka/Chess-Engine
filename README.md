# Chess-Engine
This project started as a challenge to test out my Java Swing Abilities.
Later on I came across an interesting youtube video by Sebastian Lague
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI&t=5s) about the Minimax
algorithm. As a further challenge, I decided to try implementing
this algorithm for myself.
