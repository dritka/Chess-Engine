The point of dependency tracking is to optimize the calculateMoves() function.
At the moment that Im' writing this, the calculateMoves() function calculates
the valid moves for every piece that is present on the board after a piece is
moved, but this is not always necessary becaue for most pieces the valid mvoes
sometimes remain unchanged. The idea behind dependency tracking is simple:

1. At first we calculate the moves for each piece and also add the
dependent piece for each square (this is done when calculating the
moves);
1. In the Square class keep track of a list of piece that are dependent
on the square with coordinates (r, c) [can be variable];
2. Whenever a piece is moved, instead of having to recalculate all of the
valid moves for every piece that is present on the chess board, we just
recalculate the valid moves for the piece that just moved, the pieces
that are dependent on the square that the piece just moved was and also
the pieces that are dependent on the square that the piece just moved to.

--> Uncertainties
1. What if the piece moves to a square that is occupied?
We can just iterate through the valid moves of that piece
and remove itself from the list of dependent pieces of the
corresponding square. [?]
